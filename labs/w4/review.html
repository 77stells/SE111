        <p><em>Arcane's</em> writing and animation are masterful,
            the entire show screams passion and emotion at the viewer.
            The show is truly a marvel of modern animation and storytelling.
            The characters and fit their designs perfectly and their backstories
            allow for a unique perspective where there are no real "good guys" or "bad guys".

            I would rate this series 10/10 if begged with the question, as it evoked so many 
            emotions in me during my viewing of it. The two sisters whom are the focal point of the
            show have some of the best character writing I've ever seen in modern media.
